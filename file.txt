The Caesar cipher is the simplest and oldest method of cryptography. The Caesar cipher method is 

based on a mono-alphabetic cipher and is also called a shift cipher

or additive cipher. Julius Caesar used the shift cipher (additive cipher) technique to communicate with his officers. For this reason, 

the shift cipher technique is called the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a 

kind of replacement (substitution) cipher, where all letter of plain text is replaced by another letter.

Let's take an example to understand the Caesar cipher, suppose we are shifting with 1, 

then A will be replaced by B, B will be replaced by C, C will be replaced by D, D will be replaced by C, 

and this process continues until the entire plain text is finished.

Caesar ciphers is a weak method of cryptography. It can be easily hacked. 

It means the message encrypted by this method can be easily decrypted.
